    "# calculus:--\n",
    "calculus is the branch of mathamatics that deals with the study of rates of change and acumulation of quanties . it provides a framework for understanding how things change and has two main branches differentional caculs and integral calucls\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Diffrentiail calculus :--\n",
    "it is focuses on the conncept of derivatives the derivatives of function represent the rate of change of that function.at the given point in simple terms it tess you hoew  afunction values is changib=ng as yhe input(usually denoted by \"x\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivaties of function f(x) is often denoted as f(x) or dy/dx, where y represrent variable and \"x\" represent the independent variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "# application of derivatives in finding slopes, velocities, and optimaization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "ex.,:-- Concider a car position at different time .The derivative of the position function with respect to time given you the car velocity ,which tells you how fast car is movig at a given movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Integral calculs:---\n",
    "Integral calculus, on the other hand , deals with the concept of intergration. integration allows us to find the cumulative effect or accumulation of quantities over an interval. It is often used to find areas, valumes, and totals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integralof a function f(x) with respect to 'x' oftendenoted as f(x) dx. It is essentially the reverse process of differentiation and is used to find antiderivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications in finding areas under curves, valumes of solids, and more \n",
    "\n",
    "ex,:- supose you have a velocity-time graph for a cars motion. The area under this graph, when integrated, gives you the distance traveled by the car. This is because integrating velocity over time yields the displacement.\n"
